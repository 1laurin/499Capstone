## Overview

This repository outlines the process I followed to develop my ePortfolio for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course final project. A professional portfolio is a powerful visual communication tool that highlights my unique abilities and talents, demonstrating my value to potential employers. The content of the ePortfolio provides a robust foundation to showcase my skills across key areas in Computer Science.

The included artifacts from various courses in the Computer Science Program illustrate my growth in essential categories such as software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Some artifacts highlight my expertise in a specific category while also demonstrating skills across multiple key areas.

As part of my own practice, I have enhanced and refined the selected artifacts beyond the course requirements, ensuring high-quality work by addressing limitations, inconsistencies, and vulnerabilities. This portfolio reflects my strong motivation, organizational skills, and accomplishments in the Computer Science major with a focus on Software Engineering.

### ePortfolio Selection and Software Design Document

[ePortfolio Initial Plan](https://github.com/1laurin/499Capstone/blob/76c85ed143cb211f62afc2f02fa1affcfeac4a30/CS499%20Documents/Assignment%201%20-%20Initial%20Plan.pdf "ePortfolio Initial Plan")<br/>

This paper outlines my initial plan for meeting the ePortfolio requirements. Although this plan is not final, it provides a strong starting point with clear ideas for review. This assignment serves as the beginning of a conversation that will lead to a challenging yet practical plan for creating an ePortfolio that showcases my skills across the key fields of computer science.

* Software engineering and design
* Algorithms and data structure
* Databases

### Code Review

[Artifacts Code Review](https://youtu.be/aa_6pQ9CIQM)<br/>

For each artifact selected in my initial plan, I perform a code review in a video format. During these reviews, I analyze the existing code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities, and I explain my plan for enhancements. These code reviews serve as a walk-through of both the current code and the planned improvements, demonstrating the following critical elements for each category:

Existing Functionality: A detailed walk-through of the current code, focusing on its features and functions.
Code Analysis: Identification of areas for improvement in structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documentation.
Enhancements: A walk-through of the planned enhancements that address the issues identified in the code analysis.
